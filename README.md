# Public-Version-of-studies-Project

## The Project :

This is a public version about my project made for my professional title, its a **social Media** for brewers and beer lovers. 

We was three, on this project,for my part I was mainly in charge of the **user back-end (moderation, banning, etc ...)** in the rest you will find excerpts of codes only made by myself, however having managed aspects such as security, I could not share everything. That's why I created a public version of this repos in order to share my experiences and my achievements.

I also realized a good part of the **UI/UX** of the site, as we were 3 students specialized on the **Symfony framework**, the front-end was not the most familiar point for us but I struggled to get a viable and responsive interface, usable for all.

We work with the **SCRUM** method, and use Visual Code Studio and many features. And other software like Slack, Google Drive, Discord, Trello ; to communicate share and dev.

The goal of our project it's to build a social media for **beers lovers & brewers**, to **promote exchanges** between us with **commentary, quotes or feedback**. And to share some events or new beers with community.

## The roles of each

On the project I was the **Product Owner & Git Master** and I was resonsible for Admin/User Section and Front-end/Webdesign of the app.
