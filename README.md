# Public-Version-of-studies-Project

## The Project :

This is a public version about my project made for my professional title, its a **social Media** for brewers and beer lovers. 

We was three, and we developed on Symfony, the on this project,for my part I was mainly in charge of the **user back-end (moderation, banning, etc ...)** in the rest you will find excerpts of codes only made by myself, however having managed aspects such as security, I could not share everything. That's why I created a public version of this repo in order to share my experiences and my achievements.

I also realized a good part of the **UI/UX** of the site, as we were 3 students specialized on the **Symfony framework**, the front-end was not the most familiar point for us but I struggled to get a viable and responsive interface, usable for all.

We work with the **SCRUM** method, and use Visual Code Studio and many features. And other software like Slack, Google Drive, Discord, Trello ; to communicate share and dev.

The goal of our project it's to build a social media for **beers lovers & brewers**, to **promote exchanges** between us with **commentary, quotes or feedback**. And to share some events or new beers with community.

The project was built with **Symfony so with PHP, CSS3, PureJavascript, MySQL, Twig for templates on symfony and librairies Bootstrap** to desgin the backend.

## The roles of each

*CRUD : CREATE, READ, UPDATE, & DELETE about types of Data.

On the project I was the **Product Owner & Git Master** and I was resonsible for Admin/User ( CRUD account + Admin Access + Back End User/ Moderation about the content ) Section and Front-end/Webdesign of the app.

And one was Scrum Master & Symfony referent he made the Beer Section ( Feedback, CRUD Beer, Commentary Section).
And the last was the Lead Developper who was the Boostrap Referent and made the News Sections ( CRUD News, comments ).

## STEP I : starting and Spint 0

We started to work by making a model of our app, wireframes, the mobile aspect, the user stories, as well as the MCD. You'll can find some of these documents on the folder "DocsAbouts". We made a data dictionary to describe all types of data used in app. And to finish we have planned the CRUD method for our data way in MCD & Database.


## STEP 2 : Sprint 1

- Creation of entities and profile pages :

    - User & Connect entities so User-Registration Controller, can find it in CodeSnippet folders => UserRegistration.
    - Profil page / Dynamic display can see the display on screenshot folder, the frontend on FrontEnd folder and the controller on CodeSnippet.
    - Design the display can show that on ScreenShot folder.
    - CRUD your profil and not antoher one. 

## STEP 3 : Sprint 2

    - Build a back-office with Bootstrap ( ex. on CodeSnippet).
    - Manage access-control ( Private )
    - Assignment of an admin and Super-admin role. 
    - Set up some voters to manage the security ( ex. CodeSnippet).
    - Start responsive design and other design for front-end (ex. ScreenShot & Frontend).

## STEP 4 : Last Sprint 

    - Patch some bugs or vulnerabilites like : " access to the update profil page other that one's own was made impossible ".
    - Many test performed : Register -> Login -> Read the wrong login -> Say it & retry -> Connect the good account -> Update profile with new profile picture  -> share new beer -> leave commentary -> disconnect.
    - Restrict Acces to not connected users.
    - Make Footer with general terms of use, copyright, contact, who we are.
    - Mutual aid.
